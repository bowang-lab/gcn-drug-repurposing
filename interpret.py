# interpret and visualize:
# given (load) the network/networks of drugs, diseases, proteins,
# pathways connected with each other. And the learned embeddings
# or the similarity matrix directly.
# provide several interfaces:
# - visualize the whole networks / a set of networks selected
# - given a node (drug/disease, etc.), tracing the connections
# in the networks based on exact connections or computed proximities
# - visualize a tracing result.
